### 0x13. JavaScript - Objects, Scopes and Closures

The project "JavaScript - Objects, Scopes, and Closures" focuses on understanding and implementing key concepts in JavaScript programming related to objects, scopes, and closures. 
1. Objects:
This part of the project delves into the fundamental concept of objects in JavaScript, which are collections of key-value pairs. 
Participants learn how to create, manipulate, and access properties and methods of objects.
Topics may include object literals, constructor functions, prototype inheritance, and ES6 classes.
2.Scopes:
Scopes refer to the accessibility of variables in JavaScript. 
This section explores the different types of scopes in JavaScript, such as global scope, function scope, and block scope.
Participants learn about variable hoisting, scope chains, and the use of keywords like `var`, `let`, and `const` for variable declaration.
3. Closures:
Closures are a powerful and often misunderstood concept in JavaScript. 
This part of the project focuses on understanding closures and their practical applications.
Participants learn how closures allow functions to remember and access their lexical environments even after they have exited.
Topics may include closure scope chain, closure memory management, and common use cases like creating private variables and functions.
