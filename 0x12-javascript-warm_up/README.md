### 0x12. JavaScript - Warm up

Concepts;
Why JavaScript programming is amazing
JavaScript is versatile, powering both web and server-side applications.
Its simplicity, flexibility, and wide adoption make it a powerhouse for front-end and back-end development.
How to run a JavaScript script?
You can run JavaScript scripts in web browsers, using the `<script>` tag in HTML, or via Node.js on your local machine or server.
How to create variables and constants?
Use the `var`, `const`, or `let` keywords to declare variables and constants.
Variables declared with `var` can be reassigned, while those declared with `const` and `let` provide immutable and block-scoped variables, respectively.
Differences between var, const, and let
`var` declares variables with function or global scope, `const` declares constants with immutable values, and `let` declares block-scoped variables that can be reassigned.
Data types available in JavaScript
JavaScript supports several data types, including numbers, strings, booleans, objects, arrays, functions, and symbols.
How to use if and if...else statements
Use `if` statements for conditional execution and `if...else` statements to provide alternative paths based on conditions.
How to use comments
Comments in JavaScript start with `//` for single-line comments or `/* */` for multi-line comments.
How to assign values to variables?
Assign values to variables using the assignment operator (`=`).
How to use while and for loops
Use `while` loops for repetitive execution based on a condition and `for` loops for iterating over elements of an array or a specified number of times.
How to use break and continue statements?
`break` exits the loop prematurely, while `continue` skips the current iteration and proceeds to the next one.
What is a function and how to use functions?
Functions are blocks of reusable code. Define functions with the `function` keyword, and call them by their name followed by parentheses.
What does a function that does not use any return statement return?
Functions without a `return` statement return `undefined` by default.
Scope of variables
Variables in JavaScript have global, function, or block scope, depending on how they are declared.
Arithmetic operators and how to use them
JavaScript supports arithmetic operators such as `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, and `**` for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, and exponentiation, respectively.
How to manipulate dictionary
JavaScript does not have a built-in dictionary data type but uses objects for key-value pairs.
You can manipulate objects using various methods and access values by their keys.
How to import a file?
In Node.js, use `require()` to import files, and in modern JavaScript environments, you can use `import` and `export` syntax for module importing and exporting.
